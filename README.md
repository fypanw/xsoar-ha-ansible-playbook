# Ansible Playbooks for Deploying XSOAR in HA backed by ElasticSearch

### Pre-requisites
- At least 1 freshly installed RHEL/Rocky/AlmaLinux (tested) or Ubuntu / Debian (not tested yet) server for the NFS group. This will be used for exporting the shared /var/lib/demisto directory.
- At least 2 freshly installed RHEL/Rocky/AlmaLinux (tested) or Ubuntu / Debian (not tested yet) server for the XSOAR app servers group.

### Usage
- Set up the correct parameters in inventory.yaml
- Use rhel-prep.yaml to prepare the fresh hosts with necessary packages. Modify the list of packages as needed.
- Use nfs-server-playbook.yaml to setup the NFS server (by default /var/lib/demisto is exported)
- Use xsoar-server-playbook.yaml to deploy XSOAR

### Usage for upgrades
- In case of upgrades, use the 'xsoar_upgrade_installer' setting in inventory. The installer parameter will be ignored.
